## 🚀 About the Project
**AstraGuard AI** is an open source security-focused system that combines **AI-assisted threat detection** with **practical offensive security tooling**. 

The project is built to help students, developers, and early security practitioners:
- Test applications
- Analyze risks
- Understand vulnerabilities through automation and structured reporting

The core engine handles security operations, while the AI layer focuses on attack surface analysis, smart payload generation, and guided exploitation where allowed. The audience is primarily learners who want to bridge the gap between theory and real security workflows without getting lost in complexity.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- **Build a stable AI assistant module** for smart vulnerability detection
- **Create well-scoped beginner and intermediate issues** for contributors
- **Improve documentation and onboarding flow** for new contributors
- **Add automated test pipelines** for payload validation and attack surface checks
- **Ship a working MVP** by the end of the program with measurable test coverage

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js, FastAPI
- **Security Engine**: Python
- **AI/ML**: LangChain, Local LLMs (Ollama)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / MongoDB

---

## 👥 Looking For Contributors
We are looking for **6–10 contributors** for ECWoC '26, split roughly as follows:

- **3 Frontend Contributors** (React)
- **3 Backend Contributors** (Node.js/FastAPI)
- **2–4 Security Contributors** (Python + lab-based testing)

> **Note**: Skill levels can vary, but contributions should be scoped, clean, and aligned with security best practices. No random PRs just for streaks.
