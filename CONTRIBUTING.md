## 👥 Contributor Roles & Focus Areas

We are looking for contributions in specific areas. Please identify your role and focus on relevant issues:

### 🎨 Frontend (React)

## 🚫 What We Do NOT Accept
- **Random PRs for streaks**: Submissions that just fix a typo or add a comment solely to keep a GitHub streak alive will be closed.
- **Unscoped work**: Please do not start working on a massive feature without discussing it in an issue first.
- **Low-quality code**: Code without types, tests, or documentation will not be merged.

2.  **Claim the Issue**: Comment on the issue to let us know you are working on it.
3.  **Fork & Branch**: 
    ```bash

5.  **Submit PR**: detailed description of your changes.

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines
